2. Visit ++https://aka.ms/build25/lab334/prebuild++ - for lab repo.
3. Click **Create codespace** - launches pre-built codespaces in tab.
4. Keep the tab open and wait for the VS Code terminal to be active.
5. Type ++mkdocs serve++ - select the browser option in pop-up.
6. You should now see the lab instructions preview in the browser.

_Wait for instructor guidance to continue_.


## 2. Azure Credentials

You will be assigned a temporary Azure subscription for this lab. Verify that the _Username_ and _Password_ credentials are not empty below. We will use them during setup.

- **Username:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username++
- **Password:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password++

## 3. Skillable VM Credentials

The Skillable VM has a login screen (left) that we do **NOT** need to use today. However, we may need it for troubleshooting (with proctor help). The credentials below will be useful for logging in then.

- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Username+++
- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Password+++


## 4. Time Tracking

This Skillable page has a countdown timer (top right) that will show **Hours Remaining** for lab completion. Use this to track time left and decide if you want to do optional steps accordingly. 

- You should start with at least 1h 15min on the clock.
- You will be notified when there are 10 mins left
- When timer expires, the VM will terminate automatically!

## 5. Revisiting Lab at Home

By the end of this workshop, you will have a copy of the sample app in your personal GitHub profile. Revisit it at home to explore and complete sections at your own pace. 

1. You will need your own Azure subscription for this.
1. You will need to set the "Before You Begin" tab to **Self-Guided** 
1. Then continue working through the lab steps there.
